Leap Year Checker

Create a program that determines whether a given year is a leap year. 
A leap year is a year that is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100 unless 
it is also divisible by 400.

The program should take a year as input and print "Leap year" if it is a leap 
year, and "Not a leap year" otherwise.

Example Output:
2000 is a leap year
2001 is not a leap year
2004 is a leap year
2100 is not a leap year
